        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> A classic delicious milkshake is a creamy blend of various ingredients of choice, but mainly made from <b>ice cream and milk</b>. <i> I can't be the only one who caught a whiff of that? </i> The key advantage of milkshake is the recipe. Its recipe can be manipulated to our taste of choice from various toppings through to countless mix-ins, giving a rainbow of flavours in one. <i>Mmm, love the sound of that? </i> Let's jump right into the recipe, <i> yum </i>!</p><br>

        <h3> The Basic Recipe </h3>
        <p>Below is the recipe that makes one serving but can be easily <b>doubled</b>, <b>tripled</b> and so on. Remember, we're responding to our <b>taste buds</b> </p>

        <h4>Ingredients: </h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b> 2-3 large scoops</b> of your favourite ice-cream. The most popular flavours are usually: <b> vanilla malt, chocolate, strawberry </b> and <b> oreo-cookies cream </b> but any flavour works fine </li>
            <li><b> A quarter (1/4) or half (1/2) cup of chill whole-cream milk </b>. Start with less milk and add more till your desired consistency </li>
            <li><b> Optional: </b>Toppings, flavourings (vanilla extract), mix-ins and garnishes (sprinkles, whipped cream, caramel sauce etc.) </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Steps: </h4>
        <ol>
            <li><b> Chill the serving glass </b>. This is not necessary but for better results, chill the serving glass in the freezer while you prepare the milkshake </li>
            <li><b>Soften the ice-cream</b>. For easy blending, the ice-cream must defrost or soften at room temperature for about 10-15 minutes </li>
            <li><b>Add ingredients to a blender in the following order: </b> For blender blades to work efficiently, we add liquid first (whole-cream milk in less amounts first) then flavouring (vanilla extract if using any) and finally, the softened ice-cream </li>
            <li><b>Serve immediately into your chill serving glass</b>. Add your preferable toppings or garnishes to suite taste</li>
            <li>Enjoy your milkshake!</li>
        </ol>
